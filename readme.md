Here's how you run it.
- Required python version 3.9
- Install requirements.txt (In the same folder open cmd and run pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Run main.py (Still in same folder run python main.py)
In case you get error installing requirements file, install microsoft visual studio with CMake and also Cmake on its own and try again.
